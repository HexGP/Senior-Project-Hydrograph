# Senior Project Hydrograph
 Senior Project
The purpose of the project we undertook was to create an ease-of-use application for engineers to quickly produce a Hydrograph based on Malcom’s method. Though Malcom’s method is considered to being an older method for developing hydrographs for determining the required size of a detention basin. The method, despite being a predecessor to more modern methods, is still being required by cities that have outdated policies. We created an application that we believe is simplistic in design and quick to give an adequate output.
